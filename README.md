### hola! 👋🏽

Welcome in `ranieri-unimi`'s museum 🎨 You will explore the blazing past of a chaotic-neutral student (18 academic projects + 2 theses)

💃🏽👋🏽✨🫖

- 🍎 For **DSE students**: feel free to fork any of my repos and to reach me for any feedback about exams.
- 👀 For **stalkers**: just read repository descriptions and tags. If you're too lazy or a robot (or a lazy robot) just read the emojis in the repository descriptions, that would be enought for an accurate topic extraction.
- 😶 For **other people**: you may be interested only in pinned repos below, but don't be scared to check my other projects.
